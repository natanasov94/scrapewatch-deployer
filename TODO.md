# Final document
- General concept
- Dockerization
- Short intro for kubernetes
    - Benefits of using kubernetes/microservises (CI-CD?)
- Explain microservices
    - Subsection for each microservice used
- Practical explanation (how the entire system works)

# TODO's
- UI
    - Maybe improve ui design?
    - Regardless of improvement or not, the UI section in the final document needs to be written
- Kibana
    - Maybe just add automatic dashboards? For this i need to figure out how to do it
- DB?
    - There is no need for it but it wouldn't be too hard to do it


# Add
